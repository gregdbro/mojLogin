I chose to use WDIO as the framework, Cucumber as the BDD tool, and Allure as the reporter

I chose WDIO as I knew from experience that it would be able to perform the necessary actions
and do so in great time. Other frameworks like Cypress and Playwright may also be worth
looking into.

Cucumber was my BDD tool, as I know it intimately. It can easily be used alongside WDIO.

I went with Allure as the reporter as Allure gives more visuals than the basic Spec reporter.
A combination of reporters could also be used, dependent on who the target audience is.
For example, during debugging, I would use spec. However, when displaying the results to
higher management I would always use Allure. I feel it is easier to understand from a top down level
whereas the developer will understand any issues from the command line.
